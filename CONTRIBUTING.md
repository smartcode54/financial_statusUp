Code of Conduct

All contributors are expected to adhere to our Code of Conduct. By participating, you agree to uphold our values of integrity, transparency, and respect.

How to Contribute

Reporting Bugs

If you encounter a bug in the app (e.g., incorrect interest calculations, UI issues, or crashes), please report it:





Check Existing Issues: Search the issue tracker to ensure the bug hasn’t been reported.



Open an Issue: Use the GitHub issue template to provide:





A clear title and description of the bug.



Steps to reproduce (e.g., input values for principal, rate, and time).



Expected and actual behavior.



Screenshots or logs, if applicable.



Your environment (e.g., app version, OS, browser).

Suggesting Features

We welcome ideas to improve the app, such as new calculation methods or UI enhancements:





Submit a Feature Request: Open an issue with the "Feature Request" label.



Describe the Feature: Explain the proposed feature, its use case (e.g., adding amortization schedules), and potential benefits.



Discuss: Engage with the team and community to refine the idea.

Contributing Code

We accept code contributions for bug fixes, new features, or performance improvements:





Fork the Repository: Create your own fork of the [Startup Name] repo.



Create a Branch: Use a descriptive branch name (e.g., fix/compound-interest-bug or feature/amortization-table).



Make Changes: Follow the Code Style and Standards.



Test Your Changes: Ensure your code works as intended (see Testing).



Submit a Pull Request: See Submitting Changes.

Development Setup

To set up the development environment:





Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/[startup-name]/[repo-name].git
cd [repo-name]



Install Dependencies:





For a web app, run:

npm install



For a mobile app, follow platform-specific setup (e.g., React Native, Flutter).



Run the App Locally:





Web: npm start



Mobile: Refer to the app’s README for platform-specific instructions.



Environment Requirements:





Node.js (v16 or higher)



Python (if backend calculations are involved)



Relevant IDE (e.g., VS Code)

Code Style and Standards





JavaScript/TypeScript: Follow Airbnb’s JavaScript style guide or use ESLint/Prettier configurations in the repo.



Python (if applicable): Adhere to PEP 8 standards.



File Naming: Use kebab-case for files (e.g., interest-calculator.js).



Code Documentation: Add comments for complex logic (e.g., compound interest formula: A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)).



Accessibility: Ensure UI components comply with WCAG 2.1 standards.



Error Handling: Include robust error handling for user inputs (e.g., invalid principal or rate values).

Testing





Unit Tests: Write tests for calculation logic (e.g., simple interest: I = PRT, compound interest).





Use Jest for JavaScript or pytest for Python.



Example: Test that calculateSimpleInterest(1000, 5, 2) returns 100 (principal: $1000, rate: 5%, time: 2 years).



Integration Tests: Verify the app UI correctly displays results.



Run Tests: Use npm test or equivalent to ensure all tests pass before submitting.



Test Coverage: Aim for at least 80% coverage for critical components (e.g., calculation modules).

Submitting Changes





Commit Messages:





Use clear, concise messages (e.g., “Fix bug in compound interest formula”).



Reference issue numbers (e.g., “Closes #123”).



Pull Request (PR):





Submit a PR to the main branch with a clear title and description.



Link to the related issue.



Describe changes and their impact (e.g., “Added support for monthly compounding”).



Ensure all tests pass and CI checks are green.



Code Review:





At least one team member must review and approve the PR.



Address feedback promptly.



Merge: Once approved, the PR will be merged by a maintainer.
